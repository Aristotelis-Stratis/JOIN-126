                        <h3>Nature and Purpose of Processing:</h3>
                        <p>When you access our website, i.e., if you do not register or otherwise provide information,
                            information of a general nature is automatically collected. This information (server log
                            files) includes the type of web browser, the operating system used, the domain name of your
                            Internet service provider, your IP address, and similar.</p>
                        <p>They are processed, in particular, for the following purposes:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensuring a smooth connection setup of the website,</li>
                            <li>Ensuring the smooth use of our website,</li>
                            <li>Evaluation of system security and stability, and</li>
                            <li>Optimization of our website.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We do not use your data to draw conclusions about your person. Information of this kind is
                            statistically evaluated by us if necessary, in order to optimize our internet presence and
                            the technology behind it.</p>
                        <h3>Legal Basis and Legitimate Interest:</h3>
                        <p>Processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR based on our
                            legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website.</p>

                        <h3>Recipients:</h3>
                        <p>Recipients of the data may be technical service providers who act as processors for the
                            operation and maintenance of our website.</p>
                        <h3>Storage Period:</h3>
                        <p>The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary for the purpose of
                            collection. This is generally the case for data that serves the provision of the website,
                            when the respective session is ended.</p>
                        <p>In the case of storing data in log files, this is the case after at most 14 days. Further
                            storage is possible. In this case, the IP addresses of the users are anonymized, so that an
                            assignment of the calling client is no longer possible.</p>
                        <h3>Provision Required or Necessary:</h3>
                        <p>The provision of the aforementioned personal data is neither legally nor contractually
                            required. However, without the IP address, the service and functionality of our website are
                            not guaranteed. In addition, individual services and services may not be available or
                            restricted. For this reason, an objection is excluded.</p>
